# File Upload Feature Code Review

## Overview
This code review analyzes the file-upload feature implementation in the Next.js 15 application. The feature provides secure file uploading capabilities using MinIO with presigned URLs, following modern React patterns and security best practices.

## Architecture Analysis

### ✅ Strengths

**1. Well-Structured Feature Organization**
- Follows the project's feature-based architecture perfectly
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated folders: `actions/`, `components/`, `config/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `schema/`, `types/`
- Proper barrel exports with separate server (`index.ts`) and client (`index.client.ts`) entry points
- Server-only code is properly marked with `"use server"` and `"server-only"` imports

**2. Security-First Design**
- Uses presigned URLs for secure, direct-to-storage uploads
- Server-side validation with Zod schemas prevents client-side tampering
- File type and size validation on both client and server
- Unique file naming with UUIDs prevents collision attacks
- Bucket name validation follows S3 naming conventions

**3. Type Safety & Validation**
- Comprehensive TypeScript types covering all upload scenarios
- Zod schemas for runtime validation of all inputs
- Proper error handling with typed responses
- Support for both single and multipart uploads

**4. Modern React Patterns**
- Proper use of hooks and custom hook patterns
- Controlled component design with callback props
- Efficient state management with appropriate re-render optimizations
- Proper cleanup with AbortController for upload cancellation

### ⚠️  Areas for Improvement

**1. Code Quality Issues**

```typescript
// In /actions/upload.ts - Inconsistent error handling
export async function deleteFile(bucketName: string, objectKey: string, revalidate?: string): Promise<boolean> {
   try {
      const minioClient = new MinioClient()
      const result = await minioClient.removeObject(bucketName, objectKey)
      
      // Revalidate path if provided
      if (revalidate) {
         revalidatePath(revalidate) // Should be awaited
      }
      
      return result
   } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error deleting file:", error)
      return false // Should return proper error response
   }
}
```

**2. Performance Considerations**

```typescript
// In FileUploader.tsx - Potential performance issue
const currentFiles = Object.values(fileStates).map((state) => state.file)
const pendingFiles = Object.values(fileStates).filter((state) => state.status === "pending")
// These computations run on every render - should be memoized
```

**3. Inconsistent Configuration**

```typescript
// In /(actions)/getPresignedUrl.ts - Hardcoded inappropriate values
const customConfig: Partial<FileUploadConfig> = {
   bucketName: "uploads-wow",        // Non-production naming
   uploadFolder: "sexyshit666",      // Inappropriate naming
   // ...
}
```

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Server Actions (`/actions/upload.ts`)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive CRUD operations for file management
- Proper validation using Zod schemas
- Support for both simple and multipart uploads
- Good error handling with meaningful messages

**Issues:**
- `revalidatePath` calls should be awaited
- Error responses should be consistent (some return boolean, others return error objects)
- Missing rate limiting considerations
- No logging for audit trails

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// Improved error handling pattern
interface FileOperationResult {
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
  data?: any;
}

export async function deleteFile(bucketName: string, objectKey: string, revalidate?: string): Promise<FileOperationResult> {
   try {
      const minioClient = new MinioClient()
      const result = await minioClient.removeObject(bucketName, objectKey)
      
      if (revalidate) {
         await revalidatePath(revalidate)
      }
      
      return { success: true, data: result }
   } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error deleting file:", error)
      return { 
         success: false, 
         error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error occurred" 
      }
   }
}
```

### Client Component (`/components/FileUploader.tsx`)

**Strengths:**
- Excellent user experience with drag-and-drop support
- Real-time progress tracking with speed indicators
- Concurrent uploads with semaphore pattern
- Comprehensive file validation
- Proper loading states and error handling

**Issues:**
- Performance: Multiple `Object.values()` calls on each render
- Memory: Large file lists could cause performance issues
- Accessibility: Missing proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Error recovery: Limited retry mechanisms

**Recommendations:**

```typescript
// Add memoization for expensive computations
const fileStats = useMemo(() => {
  const files = Object.values(fileStates)
  return {
    current: files.map(state => state.file),
    pending: files.filter(state => state.status === "pending"),
    uploading: files.filter(state => state.status === "uploading"),
    completed: files.filter(state => state.status === "completed"),
    failed: files.filter(state => state.status === "error")
  }
}, [fileStates])

// Add proper ARIA support
<div
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0}
  aria-label="File upload dropzone. Press Enter to select files or drag and drop files here."
  onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && fileInputRef.current?.click()}
  // ... other props
>
```

### Upload Strategy Hook (`/hooks/useUploadStrategy.ts`)

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of upload logic
- Proper abort controller implementation
- Good progress tracking
- Error handling with callbacks

**Issues:**
- Chunked upload is not implemented but referenced
- No retry logic for failed uploads
- Limited to direct uploads only

### Configuration (`/config/upload-config.ts`)

**Strengths:**
- Sensible defaults
- Merge pattern for custom configurations
- Type-safe configuration

**Issues:**
- Hard-coded file size limits
- No environment-based configuration
- Missing validation for custom configs

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Security Strengths

1. **Upload Security:**
   - Presigned URLs prevent direct server uploads
   - File type whitelist prevents malicious uploads
   - Size limits prevent DoS attacks
   - UUID-based naming prevents path traversal

2. **Validation:**
   - Server-side validation cannot be bypassed
   - Proper input sanitization with Zod

### ⚠️  Security Concerns

1. **Missing Security Headers:**
   ```typescript
   // Should add security headers for file uploads
   xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff')
   xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY')
   ```

2. **No Virus Scanning:**
   - Missing malware detection for uploaded files
   - Consider integration with ClamAV or similar

3. **No Rate Limiting:**
   - Server actions lack rate limiting
   - Could be exploited for resource exhaustion

## Performance Analysis

### ✅ Performance Strengths

1. **Efficient Upload Strategy:**
   - Direct-to-storage uploads bypass server
   - Concurrent upload processing
   - Progress tracking without blocking

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Streaming uploads don't load entire files into memory
   - Proper cleanup of abort controllers

### ⚠️  Performance Issues

1. **Client-Side Rendering:**
   ```typescript
   // Multiple expensive computations on every render
   const currentFiles = Object.values(fileStates).map((state) => state.file) // O(n)
   const pendingFiles = Object.values(fileStates).filter((state) => state.status === "pending") // O(n)
   ```

2. **No Virtual Scrolling:**
   - Large file lists could cause UI performance issues

3. **Missing Optimization:**
   - No image compression before upload
   - No duplicate file detection

## Testing Considerations

### Missing Test Coverage

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Upload strategy hook testing
   - Configuration validation
   - Error handling scenarios

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Full upload flow testing
   - Error recovery testing
   - Progress tracking accuracy

3. **E2E Tests:**
   - File drag-and-drop functionality
   - Upload cancellation
   - Large file handling

### Recommended Test Structure

```typescript
// Example test cases needed
describe('FileUploader', () => {
  it('should validate file types correctly')
  it('should handle upload progress updates')
  it('should cancel uploads properly')
  it('should retry failed uploads')
  it('should handle network errors gracefully')
})
```

## Documentation Assessment
